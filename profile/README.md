### Who we are

Partivo is an organization founded in 2020 in Turkey by three close friends. Our mission is to make a difference with cutting-edge creative services and innovative ideas in every field.

### Founding Story

Partivo's roots were formed when three visionary entrepreneurs came together. Founded in 2020, our company started with just an idea and a few passionate individuals. Our goal was to harness the power of technology to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. Today, as Partivo, we continue to grow and evolve with that mission.

At Partivo, we pride ourselves on helping our customers grow their businesses by prioritizing customer satisfaction and staying at the forefront of technological innovation. Focused on the future, we are committed to pushing boundaries and writing new success stories.
